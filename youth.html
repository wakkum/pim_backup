        <p>"Originally Palestinian." That is how I often describe myself. I am definitely proud of my heritage, but not in the most common, nationalistic way. Instead, to me, being Palestinian means being born, raised and moved across a number of countries, a process that inevitably touches and shapes who you are. </p>
        <p>My own Palestinian identity is affected by the undeniable fact that moving around so often can turn a sense loyalty or adherence to one culture into an abstract and unattainable concept. You become fragmented, unable to piece yourself together into a coherent whole, and unable to satisfy a craving for a strongly rooted, independent identity. And it is difficult to accept that you can have your own unique identity, unassociated with a flag or a specific set of norms. </p>

        <p>But once I accepted all my fragments, the truth became a set of intertwined perspectives. I built a more profound outlook on life and its questions, which then channelled itself into my identity as a filmmaker and a human being, above all else.</p>
        <p>Still, when I listen to my father's and uncles' stories about the beach in Gaza, their aunts' houses and their close-knit community, I start to feel an unhappy, tingling sensation in my heart. It's a longing, and a never-ending set of "What ifs?" tugs at me. </p>

        <p>What if our family home remained as it was? What if my cousins and I grew up on the same street, as opposed to halfway across the world from one another? Would we be closer? Would we stay close? We always speak of the right of return, but would we really go back? </p>
        <p>Perhaps we're clinging to what we cannot have, out of the mere deprivation. Then again, we have been robbed of our basic right to be nostalgic, among other things. When others speak of the beauty of their hometowns, we can only speak of the foreign land that, out of gratitude and circumstance, we still call home.</p>

        <p>Before his death, he taught me his most valuable lesson: that Yaffa is not only his home, but it is also mine. As I got older, I believed that when I would miss home, I would remember Yaffa and my grandfather's stories of our home there. But that was not the case. </p>
        <p>I was 15 when I left Gaza for the first time, going to the United States as an exchange student. Homesickness was a central theme of the experience. Whenever I felt homesick, it wasn't my grandfather's stories I remembered, nor the images he created for me of our home in Yaffa.</p>

        <p>What I remembered was my refugee camp, its narrow streets, and its houses piled on top of each other. I remembered my family, and the memories I had with them inside our small home. I remembered my mother's food, the smell and the taste of her cooking. I remembered my very own experiences as a child, rather than my grandfather's.</p>

        <p>So what does Palestine mean to me? Is it Yaffa and my grandfather's stories, hopes, and dreams? Or it is the refugee camp with the smiles and the tears it causes? To be a Palestinian means to be hopelessly stuck between those two narratives.</p>

        <p>My roots are haunting, like the voice of my father as he talked about my grandmother, Zarefah. I can taste my grandfather Muhammad's cigarettes, and smell the smoke from his gun, and the rosewater that perfumed his tea.</p>
        <p>My roots run deep, far deeper than the olive trees of Ramallah, and far stronger than the walls that currently consume my homeland. Don't be mistaken: my blood, though physically disconnected from Palestine by one generation, still runs through the streets of Gaza. My hands are rough and callused from throwing stones, and my wrists are raw from their apartheid shackles.</p>
        <p>The historical context of my very identity is the same context that pulls me to the streets in a show of solidarity with my Black, Latinx, and Muslim brothers and sisters. It is the same solidarity that brings tears to my eyes when I hear the verses of Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish or hear the words of Malcolm X. </p>

        <p>Thinking of home is the aroma of pita bread being prepared right before fajr (dawn prayer), and hearing Allahu Akbar (God is greatest) echoing through the dusty streets of Nuseirat refugee camp in Gaza, where my father was born and raised, as the sun is just beginning to make her appearance.</p>
        <p>My stones are my words, my stones are my voice, my stones are my fists raised in the air against murderous and monstrous police in the United States - who are trained by the murderous and monstrous soldiers of Israel - and against the same wall builders constructing racist, man-made borders in Palestine and Latin America. </p>
        <p>I am not diaspora. I am gunpowder. I am stones. I am olive trees whose roots run deep; like them, I cannot be uprooted. I am still Palestine.</p>

        <p>Palestinians who live in Palestine may hold the least romantic view of their homeland. </p>
        <p>For them, Palestine is a reality that they live on a daily basis, rather than the unattained utopia that many dream about, or hear of from their grandparents. Having grown up in the occupied West Bank, Palestine is not a romantic or dreamy homeland to me, but rather my real home. </p>
        <p>It is the place where my parents live, where my mother makes amazing maqlooba, where hummus is a public obsession, where I have friends and memories from childhood, and where I experienced the area's political reality in all its forms, from checkpoints and Jewish settlements to the Second Intifada and the siege of the Nativity Church in Bethlehem.</p>

        <p>In my view, that is the main difference between what it means to grow up as a Palestinian inside Palestine, and being a Palestinian in the diaspora. The perception of the place is very different.</p>
        <p>My Christian identity has also played an important part in my upbringing, and it influences who I am today. It is partly why I always talk about my hometown, Beit Sahour, which is one of the very few towns left in Palestine with a Christian majority. </p>

        <p>My grandparents were "fellahin", Palestinian peasants. They were full of knowledge on how to cultivate land, but they had not attended formal schools and were illiterate. My dad, meanwhile, grew up to become a physicist.

        <p>Fatherhood is teaching, too. My dad was my first teacher and he has dedicated 27 years to weaving my understanding of Palestine together with the many strands of our cultural identity: poetry, folklore, politics, food, literature, humour, frustration and hope.</p>

        <p>In revealing Palestine to me, he, in turn, exposed me to the contradictions of our beautiful, yet unjust world. Throughout history, powerful aggressors have blamed their victims for their own oppression, he told me. From a young age, I was versed in the brutality of racism, dehumanisation and militarism. Inversely, I was taught that solidarity and resistance were necessary antidotes. Television news in our home was always accompanied by a running commentary, with him passionately denouncing imperialists or cheering on liberation movements.</p>
        <p>With his life's work, he has instilled in me a commitment to Palestine and a commitment to struggling against oppression everywhere, a commitment which honours his parents, and a commitment that will flow through me to my children. This is what being Palestinian means to me.</p>

        <p>Being a Palestinian often means living through an unusual and illogical reality that is imposed on us. That is why I'll choose to start my story not from the beginning, but from the end.</p>
        <p>As a young, Palestinian woman, refugee camps represent something very personal to me, rather than merely a public concern. I'm willing to give everything I have to see the life of a refugee become easier. I have tolerated, and still do, a large number of difficulties in a society that is politically, economically and socially unstable, and I have tried to challenge the rules and restrictions in order to stabilise this society.</p>

        <p>I hold no legal status in Lebanon, my latest "location" as a refugee, and I'm both considered and registered as a displaced person. I see myself as a Palestinian with a right to return to my homeland, Palestine, to which I've been spiritually, mentally, and physically attached for as long as I can remember. But I'm always worried about what will happen, or where I will go next, knowing that Lebanon is definitely not my last destination. </p>
        <p>My family is originally from the village of Lubya, near Tiberias in northern Palestine. But I was born and raised in the Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus, the Syrian capital. The camp was the first point at which I solidified my relationship to Palestine, and I spent 19 years there before we had to flee the Syrian war in 2012. The war destroyed 19 years of beautiful memories and big dreams.</p>
        <p>I know it may sound strange, but Yarmouk refugee camp means nothing to me. My personal identity is not defined by geographical locations, and all I care about are the rights of the Palestinian people, wherever they are. In that sense, the fate of 500,000 refugees in Yarmouk — the displacement and loss they have suffered — matters more than my own sense of personal loss.</p>

        <p>We eventually fled to Lebanon, and I came to Burj al-Shamali refugee camp in the southern part of the country. Here, my dreams have become even harder to pursue. Being a refugee in Lebanon is harsher than in Syria; I can feel more injustice against refugees here. But my relationship to my Palestinian identity has deepened.</p>
        <p>I'm a social worker, and I work as an educational projects coordinator at American Near East Refugee Aid (ANERA), a non-profit, humanitarian aid organisation in Tyre. I'm also a member of the Palestinian Youth Network in Lebanon, a member of the Diyarouna association, which promotes youth volunteerism, and a reporter with Qalam Rasas, a magazine that focuses on life in the refugee camps.</p>
        <p>Some Palestinian refugees use their experiences as a weapon to fight their displacement and their enemy. The war today is a war of existence, after all: "to be or not to be". This is what pushes me to fight for any "temporary" Palestinian society, and help communities withstand challenges until their right of return to Palestine is realised.</p>
        <p>As a Palestinian refugee, I leave many memories behind every time I leave a place, but I have never lost, and I will never lose, my Palestinian identity or my total faith in the righteousness of the Palestinian cause. It is my cause and the cause of every single Palestinian in this world. </p>

        <p>Israeli-controlled checkpoints would later hinder my mother's connection to her family in the West Bank, where she was born and raised for nearly 12 years, but for which she now needed a permit to visit.</p>
        <p>Checkpoints have divided the two territories. They have also made accessing medical care - a right enjoyed by people all over the world - yet another impossible task for my sister. Israel denied her a permit in 2007 to undergo minor surgery in Jerusalem, after labelling her a security threat. Without treatment, Israel caused her death, at the age of only 26.</p>

I brought my cousin to the Palestine-Jordan border, as he was on his way back to Bethlehem in the West Bank. Meanwhile, I gazed at the mountains of Palestine, which appeared on the horizon, as I received the news that my friend, Ayman Shokor, was killed by Israeli shelling in Gaza.</p>

Even when, through death, she got her freedom from the Israeli occupation, the Israelis refused to give my mother a permit to attend her daughter's funeral. While both my grandmother and sister are gone, I often hear their souls encouraging me: "Maphaz, my dear, do not give up," they will say. "Keep fighting for your rights."</p>
        <p>Whenever I used to miss my grandma, I would smell the traditional, Palestinian dress that she left behind, and I wished to one day wear it to pray at Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. Once, before her death, my grandma told me to do her a favour if she were to die before returning to our land. She said: "If you ever have a chance to visit, bring some sand from [Palestine] and spread it over my grave. I will be happy to smell it." I laughed. "But you will be in your grave, how will you smell it?" I asked. She calmly replied, "Maphaz, the soul never dies, my love."</p>

        <p>Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, once said, "the old will die, and the young will forget", expecting future generations of Palestinians to give up their inalienable rights. He turned out to be wrong, and his dream remains unrealised.</p>
        <p>Our elders may die, but not without passing on the love and memories of their homes and lands in Palestine to their children, and to their children's children. We grow up with the belief that one day we will live in our ancestors' homes and that we are entitled to the "right of return" to our lands, which are now occupied by colonialists. This right means everything to us.</p>
        <p>My grandmother once told me that her only wish in life was to kiss the sand of her homeland one last time. "If I die, I wish to be buried in it," she said. I continue to see our struggle through my grandmother's eyes.</p>

        <p>It was the best and worst of times, living in Gaza under the Israeli occupation.</p>
        <p>It was the best when it was all I knew, and it was the worst once I was exposed to other ways of life, like in Spain, where I currently live and work. It was there that I first felt a bittersweet taste of freedom and I was racked with guilt to witness what life could be like elsewhere, as my nation still suffers.</p>
        <p>I had a very simple and happy childhood in Gaza, surrounded by the warmth of family and friends, yet it was full of ups and downs. I remember that I was always thirsting to see the world, or even meet the citizens of our neighbouring countries. However, the blockade was beyond limiting, and so I contented myself with watching international television shows and listening to music from the top of the charts. But even that was interrupted by daily power shortages.</p>

        <p>Luckily, the struggles of daily life in Gaza instilled me with a stubborn attitude and I was determined to pursue an education and a career abroad - a dream that finally came true after I gained my Master's degree and started a professional career here in Spain. It was refreshing to finally see that the foreign people I now live with share my eagerness - if not more - to know more about the other side of the world, Palestine.</p>
        <p>I felt very welcomed here in Spain, although it was a little heartbreaking in the beginning. When I was applying for my student residency permit, I realised that Palestine was not on the application list. I knew I was in the right place, though, once my complaint was considered, and Palestine was finally added to the list, one of the happiest moments I can recall.</p>

        <p>As I look back on it all, I feel like I am a lucky and privileged person. I have been able to roam, and visit places beyond the borders of my country; ironically, I've seen far more places than I was allowed to see within my own country itself. I am thankful today for being able to experience an ideal travel situation, where I do not have to stress over checkpoints or flip a coin and pray to make it beyond closed borders. I am also grateful to live in a peaceful environment, where I can feel safe and lead a stress-free life, at least for the time being. This is the most I have ever been free.</p>
        <p>Finally, I am blessed to be surrounded by an optimistic and a dynamic nation, which is genuinely interested in my story, my background, and my country. Despite all the differences between my two realities, I still feel a connection between the people of Spain, and my own people; both are optimistic and hopeful. My plan is to continue enriching my experience abroad and make the best out of it until I return home and use all my positive experiences to make a difference socially and economically in Palestine.</p>

        <p>Palestine has always been our goal and dream. Palestine is like my mother, always embracing me when I feel disappointed or defeated. I see Palestine in front of me with every step I take in the refugee camp. Everything there reminds me of Palestine and of the sense of hope that the great Palestinian writer Ghassan Kanafani described when he said: "You have a goal in this life, go after it." Despite all the difficulties, oppression, injustices, racism, and disappointments we experience there, the refugee camps are the main witnesses to our right to return, and they always remind us of this right. I can't help but remember Palestine as I wander through the camp's streets, from the al-Quds neighbourhood to the Safouri, Safsaf, al-Ras al-Ahmer, al-Zeeb and Tabariya districts - all named after cities and towns in historic Palestine.</p>
        <p>This is how we live, always attached to our homeland. My grandfather and grandmother always tell us stories about Palestine, about their childhoods, about how they used to live happily, and about how "life was much better than today". They speak about how everything changed when "those bastards came and turned our lives upside down, stole our land, forced us out of our homes and killed many of our youth who sacrificed their lives for Palestine and for the sake of Palestinians." They have thousands and thousands of stories.</p>
        <p>My father joined the Palestinian revolution when he was a teenager. He always talked about the importance of their struggle and about how every Palestinian and free Arab in this world must fight for, and defend, the Palestinian cause. His answers to my countless questions enriched my awareness of our cause and deepened my strong faith that, as a human being, I have rights and must fiercely fight to reclaim them. My mother, who has always supported my father, makes me even more determined when she says: "Those who don't do good for their homeland, do no good for anyone else!"</p>

        <p>In 2012, I finally became whole, and my body and soul were reunited for a few days: I finally went home to Palestine. For those few days, I was not a "refugee" anymore, and they were both the happiest and saddest days of my life.</p>
        <p>I walked in the streets of Ramallah, Nablus, Bethlehem and Jenin with so much confidence because I finally felt that I was not a stranger. My homeland embraced me and I apologised for being away for so long.</p>
        <p>I will never be able to describe how beautiful those days were. I felt the air on my face and smelled the water. I saw the sky, the land, the people, the walls, the sun, the moon, the rain and the cold weather. Everything seemed different, but familiar, because this is where I am from. I would smile, laugh, and think about how lucky I was, but then I would cry when I remembered that I was deprived of my homeland and that I would soon go back to being "a refugee" again. </p>
        <p>Despite being a son of this land, I could only visit Palestine, while others get to enjoy my precious homeland every day.</p>
        <p>But I promised my beloved Palestine that one day, no matter how far in the future that is, I will return and I will rest in Palestine's arms because "on this land, there is something to live for".</p>
