        <p>Soon, my wife and I will leave Hawaii again.</p>
        <p>It is always a struggle. The hardest was in 1970, after I finished my medical training. Beyond lucrative job offers, Hawaii's comforts and beauty tugged at our heartstrings. But the Galilee won. I was needed there - and I owed Arrabeh more than she did Honolulu.</p>
        <p>My family had sold land to our neighbours to put two of my four brothers and me through high school in Nazareth. In our subsistence farming culture, that was blasphemous. Land was holy and farming was worship.</p>
        <p>Still, with the promise of returning as a physician, I persuaded my father to sell another acre of land to pay for my one-way ticket to America. It was his last plot of land in our fertile Battouf Valley, believed to be the home of the ancient Natufians, the first settled agricultural society in human history. He held onto his olive grove and apricot orchard on the mountainside. Those roots go deep; to cop out when I became a physician would have been more than blasphemous; it would have been treasonous, un-Palestinian.</p>
        <p>When I returned, there was no other physician among Arrabeh's 6,000 people. Sheikh Kaid, the village imam, had led a committee of civic activists and brought running water into homes, a great public health feat. But no one had thought of liquid waste disposal. Soon, sewage seeped into the dirt alleys and pooled in puddles. This public health nightmare alarmed me more than the lack of rubbish collection, electricity, telephone, paved roads and adequate public transportation combined. As I surveyed the situation, I discovered that it was black and white: All the Jewish settlements in Israel had a functioning sewage network, but no Arab village had one, nor could afford to install one.</p>

                Israeli settlers are Jewish Israelis who live in settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories of East Jerusalem and the West Bank, and in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights. Unlike Palestinians, who live under military rule in the West Bank, Israelis in the West Bank live under civil law, creating a de facto apartheid reality of two legal systems.            </p>

        <p>I wrote memos to my superiors in the Ministry of Health. It wasn't their responsibility, I was told. Arrabeh had elected a village council, an ineffectual invention representing the Zionist central authority in the village and the punching bag the state could blame for all its shortcomings. <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/israel.html" target="_blank">Israel</a> was the state of the Jews, and we were left to stew in our own foul juices. After all, we didn't serve in the Israeli army, the IDF.</p>
        <p>Israel was "a light to the nations," but we were no nation; we were hardly human in their eyes. Incidentally, I should use the term "bnei-miutim" - minority members - in my reports, not Arabs or, God forbid, Palestinians, I was advised.</p>

              Yes. Although the Zionist narrative insists that Palestine is the historic homeland for the Jewish people, it is argued that the idea of Israel as “the national home of the Jewish people” was at the centre of modern Zionism, which emerged in the late 19th century.</br>Source: <<a href="http://world.time.com/2011/07/07/is-israel-the-national-home-of-the-jewish-people/" target="_blank">Source: TIME.com</a>

        <br>
        <p>Though specialised in public health, I had to double as a general practitioner. Among the Galilee's rural Palestinian citizens of over 200,000, there were only two other physicians.</p>
        <p>Fast-forward to the present, and Arrabeh claims the highest physician-to-resident ratio in any town of its size in the world, thanks in large part to the sacrifices of parents and siblings that toiled away in construction and manufacturing to support those doctors' studies.</p>
        <p>The mainly foreign-trained physicians, pharmacists, dentists and other health professionals among Palestinian citizens of Israel are fast becoming the backbone of Israel's healthcare system, contrary to its planners' vision. In 1976, an internal government document known as the Koenig Report recommended that the state encourage our brain drain, among other measures.</p>

              The question of how or why Palestinians left historical Palestine is inconsequential under international law.  What is important is that they are allowed to exercise the right of return, as stipulated in Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that “everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.”

          <br>

        <p>Like Arrabeh, many of those erased had previously survived the riptide of history for as many as four millennia since the Canaanites first established them. With the arrival of the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/israel.html" target="_blank">invading</a> Zionist forces, the 11-year-old child I was at the time faced a weighty decision: carry the cage in which I kept the two blackbirds I had collected from a nest in our apricot orchard or abandon them.</p>
        <p>My parents, meanwhile, faced the impossible choice of staying in Palestine and likely suffering the fate of Deir Yassin - a Jerusalem village where Zionist forces massacred men, women and children - or leaving and becoming refugees like the distraught people of Suffoureyeh we had seen passing through our olive groves, some of whom even lost their children along the way. But soon, crossing to Lebanon was no longer possible. Every home in Arrabeh and in the two neighbouring villages, Sakhnin and Deir Hanna, planted a stick on its roof and tied a white sheet to it. The Haganah, a Zionist militia, took able-bodied, Palestinian men to labour camps as prisoners of war, and collected our milking cows and work bulls to feed its soldiers.</p>
        <p>In the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/specialseries/2013/05/20135612348774619.html" target="_blank">Nakba</a> (catastrophe) of 1948, Palestine lost its cohesion as a nation; all Palestinian urban centres in what became Israel were ethnically cleansed. Our major human, cultural, and financial capital was decimated. But Nazareth was an exception: a commander of the invading Haganah, based on his exceptional awareness of the war crime they encoded, disobeyed the orders of his superiors.</p>

              <span class='georgia'>A:</span>
              Under United Nations Resolution 194, Palestinians are entitled to return to their homes and villages from which they were expelled. The resolution describes three aspects of the right of return: repatriation, restitution of property and compensation for the losses incurred from Palestinians’ inability to use their property, and the psychological suffering they experienced. General Assembly Resolution 3236 also describes the right of return as “inalienable”.            </p>

        <p>Still, countless Palestinians on Nazareth's outskirts were forced from their homes and villages and pushed into <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/05/nakba-internalised-exiled-palestinians-170514104942696.html" target="_blank">exile</a>.</p>
        <p>In the 1950s, David Ben-Gurion, Israel's first prime minister, saw this Palestinian geographic continuity as a demographic threat and wedged the Jewish town of Upper Nazareth, Natzeret Illit, in its heart. On one occasion, about three decades later, Upper Nazareth let its collected sewage flood the fields of its downhill neighbour, the Palestinian town of Kufr Kana, the biblical Cana of Galilee. When I, as the regional public health official at the time, demanded they stop the public health menace, the city countered with the demand that Kufr Kana stop their "sound pollution": the dawn-time call for prayer.</p>

        <p>In 1948, my aunt, Samiyeh Rustom, exiled from her home in Sheikh Dannoun, one of three such aunts, passed through Arrabeh with her family on their way to Lebanon. They bequeathed us Arrabeh's first radio and second Singer sewing machine, both adding to the prestige and livelihood of the Kanaanehs. It was only after Israel's takeover of south Lebanon and its propaganda ploy of The Good Wall - during which Israel opened the gates in the barbwire border with Lebanon to allow workers and some visitors from south Lebanon to enter - that we briefly reconnected with our cousins again.</p>
        <p>Shortly thereafter, the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/09/2012915163152213255.html" target="_blank">Sabra and Shatila</a> war crime - the massacre of Palestinian civilians in two refugee camps in Beirut - shocked the conscience of the world. Ariel Sharon was then Israel's defence minister. Under his command, Israeli soldiers besieged Sabra and Shatila and watched as the Lebanese Phalangist militias they sent in perpetrated the killings.</p>

              <span class='georgia'>A:</span>
              The international community can help Palestinians in two major ways: boycotting Israel and directly supporting Palestine. That means people can visit Palestine, shop and trade with Palestinians, and publicly encourage them. At the same time, they should boycott Israel and Israeli products and public meetings, until it respects international law and ends its occupation

        <br>
        <p>After the 1956 Kafr Qassim Massacre, Israeli military Commander Issachar Shadmi was fined one cent for ordering the execution of 49 Palestinian civilians, including 23 children. In contrast, Sharon fully escaped punishment for the Sabra and Shatila massacre and even went on to become Israel's prime minister. That reconfirmed our convictions that Zionism was intent on expelling, if not exterminating, us. The IDF had contingency plans.</p>

              No monetary value can be assigned to the distress caused by the destruction and loss of life, community, culture, shelter and homeland. Therefore, any assessment of the economic cost of the occupation on the Palestinian people is, at best, a partial measurement of losses incurred since the Zionist project began.

        <p>Then came the <a href="http://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/PalestineRemix/phone/the-price-of-oslo.html" target="_blank">Oslo Accords</a>, in which we, the 48 Palestinians (Palestinian citizens of Israel), were totally excluded as possible caddies for either side.

        <p>Then, at the start of the second millennium, Sharon played the fanatic religious card with a visit to Al-Aqsa mosque grounds in Jerusalem and inflamed the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2003/12/20084101554875168.html" target="_blank">Second Intifada</a>. Demonstrations broke out within the Green Line, the imaginary armistice line that separates the occupied West Bank from Israel proper, in solidarity. Israeli police, most notably its snipers, killed 13 of our youth, including two from Arrabeh: Aseel Asleh and Ala'a Nassar. The earth rose and wouldn't sit, as the Arabic expression goes.</p>
        <p>An Israeli investigative committee, The Or Commission, was appointed to look into the events. It fed media cycles for months before a hefty, final report blamed the violence on unequal access to state resources between Jewish and Palestinian communities. Plans for development funding for our communities were drawn then, but they are still being debated by the Israeli settler cabinet of today. No one was punished for the execution-style deaths of October 2000. Cynics discern a pattern of periodic punishments meant to keep us in line, not unlike Israel's genocidal attacks on Gaza that its commanders call "mowing the lawn".</p>

              Palestinians live under various legal regimes depending on where they reside. In the West Bank and Gaza, the Palestinian Authority (PA) provides Palestinians with passports or travel documents. PA passports are not issued to Jerusalem’s Palestinian residents. Many travel on Jordanian passports, which are travel documents since they do not have Jordanian “national numbers”.

        <p>As leaderless peasantry, we were placed under draconian, Israeli military rule for nearly two decades (from 1948 to 1966), a period during which our land, our youth, our culture and our minds were targeted. The "abandoned property" of refugees, including internally displaced Palestinians, reverted to the state for the benefit of Jews only. We were elided from the beneficiaries of Israel's "public domain," for which our land was appropriated disproportionately. The cumulative effects of dozens of specifically fashioned laws and the discriminatory practices of the Jewish majority led to the current situation in which Palestinian citizens, despite constituting one-fifth of Israel's population, own less than three percent and have legal access to less than seven percent of the land.</p>
        <p>Despite this constant pressure, we made a fateful and subliminal decision. We decided that we would remain culturally Arab, nationally Palestinian, and emotionally still peasants, even when the land was being stolen out from underneath us, "a dunam [1,000 square metres] here and a metre there." On all these fronts, Israel's daily practices only reinforced our will to resist.</p>

        <p>Organised land defence took the form of an attempt at establishing the Al-Ard Movement, a Nasserite, pan-Arab stirring that so alarmed Israel a special law was passed to outlaw it. Its activists quickly found themselves behind bars or forced outside Israel's borders, if not assassinated. At the other end of our community's identity politics, Mapai, Israel's leading Zionist Labor party, bribed and threatened "mukhtars" - appointed leaders - and clan chiefs who were losing their traditional roles. Some such coopted figures successfully ran for parliamentary seats on "independent" Arab lists. Such lists were organised, financed, promoted, and carefully controlled by Mapai. They raised their hands when they were signalled to do so, often not understanding what they voted for or against.

Hence, its interpretation of the right to defend itself very often involves indiscriminate and disproportional violence, war, assassinations and extrajudicial killings

        <p>Meanwhile, the Israeli majority's open enmity to the Communists as the only legal, non-Zionist political party led to a contradictory phenomenon: "The Party" of international brotherhood of the proletariat became the only legal outlet for our Palestinian national sentiments. The advent of radio and print media helped. We locked the doors to our rented rooms in Nazareth and sat next to the dimmed radio to listen to Gamal Abdel Nasser, the Egyptian president who called for pan-Arab unity.</p>
        <p>We held nightlong parties in secret, where we drank strong tea, ate knafeh (a Palestinian cheese pastry soaked in syrup), and listened to legendary Egyptian diva, Umm Kulthum. The likes of Rashid Hussein, Mahmoud Darwish, Samih el-Qasim and Taha Muhammad Ali crossed all restrictive borders to help us assert our identity. Their voices were heard across the Arab world.</p>

        <br>
        <p>In 1976, as the Israeli state continued its mockery of justice and moved to codify greater discrimination against us, wide swaths of privately owned, Palestinian land were targeted for another wave of confiscation. This hit three neighbouring Galilee villages the hardest: Arrabeh, Sakhnin and Deir Hanna, which have since become known as The Land Day Triangle.</p>
        <p>But by this time, the stirrings of open nationalism were in the air. A Committee for the Defence of Land had been established.</p>
        <p>Nazareth had conceptualised all of our inner sentiments, aspirations, and contradictions, in the persona of its new, young mayor, the Communist party parliament member and eloquent poet, Toufiq Zayyad. He sensed the pulse of our community and forged ahead with a "revolutionary" decision: For the first time since the Nakba, we all stood as one and said "NO!"</p>

              The PLO’s shift goes back to December 7, 1988, when Yasser Arafat signed the Stockholm Document recognising Israel, accepting Resolutions 242 and 338, and renouncing “terror”. Then-US Secretary of State George Shultz set out these conditions for the conduct of any negotiations with the PLO. A dialogue between the US and the PLO got underway in Tunis on December 17, 1988.

        <br>
        <p>A call was issued for a one-day strike, March 30, in objection to the planned confiscation of our land. The Zionist shadow theatre operators had organised a forum of Arab mayors in the hopes they would rubber-stamp their dictates. Using his many gifts - a shrill voice, full command of the Arabic language, group psychology and great sense of humour - Zayyad outwitted the collaborators; he turned the tables against the defeatists, silencing their whimpering, and the one-day strike was  unanimously endorsed at the meeting originally held to cancel it.</p>
        <p>Alarmed, Prime Minister Rabin and his Defense Minister Shimon Peres imposed a curfew and sent Golani Brigade troops in tanks into our villages to enforce it. Six young Palestinians were killed in the ensuing atrocities, the first being Kheir Yassin of Arrabeh. Ever since, Land Day has become a national memorial every year, commemorated by any and all Palestinians that survived.</p>

        <p>That morning, on March 30, 1976, I made another fateful, personal choice: a neighbour called from across the field for me to come help his wife, who had gone into labour. I could see soldiers in a tank on the other side of the field. I waved at them with my stethoscope and they pointed their automatic weapons at me. I went back inside and told my wife that we were moving to Hawaii for the safety of our two children. I wrote a letter of resignation to the Minister of Health to the effect that I can no longer serve in a system that does what this one is doing to its Arab citizens.</p>

        <p>But two years later, using the same justification of wanting to keep our children safe, we returned to the social warmth of our Palestinian rural community. I returned to my former ministry job, but this time, I had a clear partisan agenda: to mine the system against its wishes for the benefit of my people.</p>
        <p>That's where the plan to establish a non-governmental organisation, the Galilee Society for Health Research and Services, first came from; the NGO was legally registered in 1981. The Galilee Society fast became my public health forum. I took repeated leave of absences from my MOH position to challenge the system and respond to my community's health needs. Twice, in 1986 and 1992, while on such absences, I led the process of organising Arab Health Conferences, while "my" MOH banned its employees from participating. The Follow-up Committee for Arab Health was thus established to work alongside and advise the political structure made up of all elected Arab officials in Israel, the Higher Follow-up Committee. The Galilee Society continues to serve the community today, guided by its independent, professional vision.</p>

        <p>The first significant project we at the Galilee Society addressed was the sewage problem in Arab villages. But along the way, and guided by the likes of Mohammed Abu-Elhaija and his indigenous NGO, The Association of Forty, we stumbled across another dark corner of Israel's manipulation and land theft: the unrecognised villages.</p>
        <p>The Planning and Building Law of 1965 had left scores of existing, Palestinian villages off its official maps, thus rendering them illegal and their residents, trespassers. The state ultimately wanted the villages to be replaced by Jewish settlements. In the meantime, they were deprived of basic services and amenities.</p>

              Israeli settlers are Jewish Israelis who live in settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories of East Jerusalem and the West Bank, and in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights. Unlike Palestinians, who live under military rule in the West Bank, Israelis in the West Bank live under civil law, creating a de facto apartheid reality of two legal systems.

        <p>Abu-Elhaija's own village, Ein Houd, illuminated one side of this riddle. In 1948, as the residents of the original, Palestinian Carmel Mountain village were driven out of their homes, one family decided to camp out in their olive grove. This encampment grew into the new Ein Houd. Meanwhile, Israeli artists, some internationally famous, took over the original village, using it as an artists' colony, Ein Hud.</p>

The Arab Bedouin population stands at approximately 170,000, which is 14 percent of the total Negev population. Of these, between 75,000 and 90,000 live in unrecognised “illegal clusters”, many of which have been in existence before the establishment of the state of Israel. <br><a  href="https://www.adalah.org/uploads/oldfiles/upfiles/2011/Adalah_The_Inequality_Report_March_2011.pdf" target="_blank">(Source: Adala)</a>

        <p>Ben-Gurion romanticised the region as an empty desert in which he could expand his personal colonial project; it was "a land without a people", like all of Palestine, according to Zionist propaganda. Israeli authorities have dismissed the centuries-old native claims to the land, and moved indigenous residents at will, denying them their land-based lifestyle and property rights. The current, settler-dominated government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu coordinates its aggression to exile Bedouins from their villages with the Jewish National Fund, a quasi-state agency that holds and allocates land for Jewish purposes only.</p>
        <p>The Israeli authorities have demolished the Bedouin village of al-Araqib, in the northern Naqab, over 110 times, to make room for a JNF-sponsored forest. The nearby Bedouin village of Umm El-Hiran, meanwhile, is to be replaced by a Jewish settlement of the same name. The list goes on.</p>

              The Israeli government uses the term “Israeli Arab” to refer to Palestinians in Israel. It is seen by Palestinians in Israel as an attempt to erase their Palestinian identity and history by designating them “Israelis”. Generally, Palestinians in Israel refer to themselves as “Palestinians of the inside”, or as “48 Arabs”, referring to the Palestinians that remained on their lands during the Nakba of 1948.

        <p>These residents were mostly internally displaced villagers who sought refuge in abandoned city homes. The "legal owner" of their city residences, the Custodian of Absentee Properties, often prevented them from repairing their squatting quarters. Internal exile, social alienation, unemployment, physical disintegration, the apartheid policies of the state, and the daily practices of its field-level operatives turned the congregated former farmers into slum-dwellers.</p>
        <p>In turn, the burgeoning Zionist middle class of these cities sought to protect its privileges by walling itself off from such "hostile" others. "Their suburban ethnic purity, their total residential segregation, and their social engineering" resulted in mental and physical walls of separation between the two groups, which were manifested through harsh policing practices, concrete and barbed wire.</p>

        <p>While residential separation by race, like the separate-and-unequal educational system, is not absolute, the reality of persistent inequality is nearly omnipresent. Rural Palestinian communities in Israel are hemmed-in by the invisible borders imposed by the Zoning and Planning Law. Foot-dragging by the central authorities on requests to enlarge our building zones on the one hand, and our high population growth rates on the other, have resulted in young couples frequently building "illegally" on our remaining agricultural land. Tens of thousands of such homes face the threat of fines and demolition. Another zoning law, known as the Kaminitz Law, was recently passed to expedite the demolition of such "illegally" built homes.</p>
        <p>As the Israeli state took shape, Ben-Gurion set an upper limit to the country's Palestinians at 15 percent of Israel's total population. Decades later, Rabin raised that to 20 percent.

              Zionist gangs expelled about 805,000 Palestinian civilians from their towns and villages in 1948. Three-quarters of the Palestinian population was expelled, and 531 villages were depopulated and destroyed. Three main Zionist groups carried out the ethnic cleansing: the Haganah, which dates back to the late 19th century, the Irgun Zvei Leumi and the Stern Gang.

The project is "inspired by and rooted in the rich legacy of Black-Palestinian solidarity," and it is evidence that lasting and critical links are being forged between the two oppressed groups.</p>
        <p>The project's creation was music to my ears! Not only that, but it was launched on Nakba Day, May 15, which also marked my 80th birthday. What better present could I have asked for?</p>
